Get your motor runnin', head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure and whatever comes our way
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space

I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind and the feelin' that I'm under
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space

Like a true nature's child, we were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high, I never wanna die

Born to be wild, born to be wild

Get your motor runnin', head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure and whatever comes our way
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space

Like a true nature's child, we were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high, I never wanna die

Born to be wild, born to be wild
