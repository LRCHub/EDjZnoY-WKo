(Be wild)
Born to be wild (born to be wild)
Born to be wild (born to be wild)

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild (born to be wild)
Born to be wild (born to be wild)

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Yeah, darling, go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild (born to be wild)
Born to be wild (born to be wild)

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild (born to be wild)
Born to be wild (born to be wild)
