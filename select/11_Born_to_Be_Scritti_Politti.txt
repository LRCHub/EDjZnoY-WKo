I was born to be with you
I was born by the way
Born to betray
I was born to be with you

I was born to be with you
I was born disinclined
Out of kindness or mind
I was born to be with you

I believe that everyone can find their perfect match
Millions are lonely, uninvolved and unattached
You can count me among them if you can find me at all
The man in the moon used to say I was born to be with you

I was born to be with you
I was born prepossessed
Of your worst and your best
I was born to be with you

I was born to be with you
Such a dumb thing to say
Such a high price to pay
To be born to be with you

Destiny upside your head, and stars are in your hands
I make no decisions, declarations or demands
You can count all your blessings on the one hand of time
The man in the moon used to say I was born to be with you

Oh woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah

I was born to be with you
I decided today
Who's to know, who's to say
I was born to be with you

Born to be with you
Born to be with you (I decided)
Born to be with you
And no one can stop...

Born to be with you(I was born)
Born to be with you (now)
Born to be with you (with you little girl)
Born to be with you (you're in my hands)

Born to be with you
And no one can stop...
Born to be with you (I've decided)
Born to be with you (you're in my hands)

Born to be with you
Born to be with you
Born to be with you (the stars are crossed)
Born to be with you (over our town)

Born to be with you
Born to be with you
